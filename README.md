* Multi-Agent Systems
* Automaton Systems

## Min-Max Algorithm

Min-Max algorithm is a decision tree that results in maximizing player's utility while minimizing opponent's utility.
We notice in zero-sum games, it is more optimal to try and reduce the opponent's utility than maximizing our own. 
This is the core idea behind our solver in this case.

## Multi Agent Decentralized Collision-Free system

This is a system of decentralized agents, moving without collisions or deadlocks (under constraints). Motivation for the program is a research paper attached with the code.
